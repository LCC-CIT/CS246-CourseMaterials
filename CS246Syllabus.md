## Course Description 

In this course, students will learn to design and plan the development of software systems. Topics covered will include requirements gathering, design evaluation and documentation, and object-oriented program design. By the end of the course, students will have produced a design for a significant software project as part of a team. 

### Learning Outcomes 

The goal of this course is to prepare you to design and plan significant software projects. You will learn to identify needs, create user stories, manage those stories using project planning tools, and validate your design with appropriate software testing. 

### Teaching Methods

This hybrid course combines lectures, discussions, and labs for on-campus and online learners. Online students may participate live via Zoom or watch recordings asynchronously. 

Group work is a core component; remote students can collaborate during class time via Zoom breakout rooms or coordinate independent meetings at a time that works for everyone in their group.



## Learning Resources 

### Readings

There is no textbook for this course. Online reading will be assigned as the course progresses.

### Moodle 

http://classes.lanecc.edu (LCC’s Moodle site) is the learning management system for the course. All of the information you need for the course will be provided via the Moodle course page: lecture notes, sample files, assignment descriptions and due dates, and announcements related to the course. 

### Required Software

The class examples are based on using the Windows operating system for development, but you may alternatively use Mac OS or Linux. 

#### IDE and .NET Framework

We will be using [Visual Studio 2022, Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), which is available as a free download. This is the most popular IDE for .NET development on Windows.

For Mac OS and Linux, the best IDE is [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), which also runs on Windows and is available free to students.

The version of the .NET framework we will be using is [.NET Core 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0). You will need to download the latest release of this version of the .NET framework SDK for your OS (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

#### Git

You will need to use Git for version control. Git is a command-line program that you can [download from the Git Community web site](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You can use Git from the command line, or use a Git GUI client. There is a very good [Git client built into Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-with-visual-studio?view=vs-2022) and you can also download the free [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app for working with Git.

### CIT Computer Lab

The CIT Main lab (Bldg. 19, room 135) is equipped with computers and software available exclusively for students in the CIT department. There are tutors available in the lab to help you with your lab work. The schedule for when the lab will be open and when in-person tutors are available is TBD.

#### Online Tutoring

See the [LCC Tutoring Services](https://www.lanecc.edu/tutor) web page for information.



## Assessment and Grading

You will achieve the course the learning outcomes and demonstrate your proficiency by completing weekly assignments, in-class activities, and a term project that will serve as a design for your capstone project in the spring. 

| Activity                     | Percentage of grade |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Assignments                  | 50%                 |
| In-class / online activities | 10%                 |
| Term Project                 | 40%                 |

For the term project, you will be organized into groups of two to four students (the ideal size is three). These groups will also be your project groups for the capstone course in the spring. Groups will be organized early in the term. 

Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:        

|      | -        |         | +       |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| A    | 90 - 91  | 92 - 97 | 98-100  |
| B    | 80 - 81  | 82 - 87 | 88 - 89 |
| C    | 70 - 71  | 72 - 77 | 78 - 79 |
| D    | 60 - 61  | 62 - 67 | 68 - 69 |
| F    | Below 60 |         |         |

### Late Work

- The grade for assignments submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%.
- No late assignments will be accepted after the end of week 10.
- Exceptions will only be made for illness or emergency situations.

### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss assignments and help each other, each student is responsible for their own work. In other words, you can help each other, but you cannot copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's individual work.

#### Use of AI

Generative AI tools such as Gemini, Claude or ChatGPT are useful resources and you are encouraged to use them to help you learn concepts and techniques, but not to produce text, code or other content for your assignments unless a specific assignment has instructions that direct you to use AI.

Any time AI is used as part of the coding process, you need to provide a comment or other documentation explaining what AI tools were used and how they were used.

### Attendance

Attendance is not graded but will be essential for successful completion of the class. Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining the course content provided in class and mastering it. 

### No-Show Drop

LCC has a [no-show drop](https://www.lanecc.edu/esfs/noshow-drops) policy, which means that during the first week of the term, to avoid being dropped, a student must attend at least one class meeting, or complete one assignment or quiz.



## Accessibility and Campus Navigation

### Center for Accessible Resources

Lane Community College (LCC) is dedicated to providing inclusive learning environments.
